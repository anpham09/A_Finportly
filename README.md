## Story

Managing finances can feel overwhelming, especially when you're new to it. I created **Finportly** to simplify financial reporting by offering a clear, user-friendly interface. Instead of spending hours formatting data in spreadsheets, users can quickly input their information and get an organized report â€” ready to use or share.

## Obstacles

Designing the layout to be both simple and functional took several iterations. Ensuring the data input was intuitive and flexible â€” without overwhelming the user â€” was a key challenge. Additionally, I had to carefully plan how the data should be processed and displayed to make the final report accurate and clear.
